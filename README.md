# 0flufNight 🌙

> **0flufNight** is a high-performance browser extension designed to protect your eyes and improve sleep quality by filtering out harsh blue light. By applying a customizable, warm amber overlay to every website you visit, it makes late-night browsing significantly more comfortable and less disruptive to your natural sleep cycle.
